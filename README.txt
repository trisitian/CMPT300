This assignment is a collaboration between Jinhan Liu (301430717) and Tristian Labanowich (301422226).

*PLEASE NOTE WE WILL BE USING 2 LATE DAYS EACH FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT

Collectively we spent about 40 hours on the project.
(Tristian): 
This assignment only reminded me of how greatfull I am for modern programming languages. So much of the diffiulty surrounding 
this assignment was in relation to dealing with the proper implemntation of pointers (especially pointers to pointers). I did
get a greater understanding of bitwise operators and a few more system calls with the implemntation which was quite nice. I would 
only say this assignment took longer then it should of do to a lack of features in core c.

(Jinhan): This assignment definitely required a lot of research into scandir(). We originally took a different
approach to reading files, but in order to achieve sorting the code was rewritten to use the built-in alphasort.
This is the first project for this semester where we did not use Jira to track issues and progress, which led to
a slow start and many reimplementation of methods because there weren't much planning. However, the assignment
was overall manageable and not overly intimidating.
