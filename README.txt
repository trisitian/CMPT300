README for CMPT300 Assignment 2

This assignment was a collaboration between Jinhan Liu (301430717) and Tristian Labanowich (301422226).

This assignment took around 20-25 hours between the two of us. 

Tristian Labanowich:
    Something That I learned was how important pre planing control flow is in a program.
    I spent quite a few hours getting a bunch of the built in functions working only to realise
when writing script mode that they should be actual functions that are called to reduce the code bloating
which then caused issues of its own. With that being said Planning was a huge take away from this. The assignment
seemed overwhelming at first however the two of us sat down and planned a taskboard together (Jira) before even starting
this made the production of the shell a lot more approachable and I always had a clear goal when programming.

Jinhan Liu:
    I learned the importance of refractoring code, as well as how proper commenting can help with navigating the code.
    It's a good review on C functions and syntax, as well as a more in-depth look at pointers.
    A lot of effort was put into setting boundaries of the user navigatable space, and catching inputs that might disrupt the program.
    I also had the idea of using flags (int) to reduce code redundancy and make the program easier to read. E.g. script mode and interactive
mode used to contain the same block of code, but each contained to their own loops. However, with a help of an indicator for script mode, it
is now possible to run code specific to script mode under one loop shared with interactive mode.
