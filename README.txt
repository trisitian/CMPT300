Collectively we spent about 30-35 hours on the project.
(Tristian): Alot of this time was figuring out the ropes for threads, seeing how to pass arguments properly. having them start the way we wanted to.
I'll be honest in class I didn't fully see the problem and why mutes were needed for an assignment like this but after working through the program I 
definetly got a good understanding of why they were necissary. 

(Jinhan): The heavy emphasis of semaphores on this assignment does show the importance in understanding order of executions. 
As someone who has never done socket programming, it took around 5-7 hours to establish a working UDP localhost connection. 
The list.h file provided was easy to understand and fast to implement. The trickist part was getting the semaphores right.
