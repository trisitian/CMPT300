README for CMPT300 Assignment 2

This assignment was a collaboration between Jinhan Liu (301430717) and Tristian Labanowich (301422226).

This assignment took around 20-25 hours between the two of us. 

Something That I learned was how important pre planing control flow is in a program (Tristian)
I spent quite a few hours getting a bunch of the built in functions working only to realise
when writing script mode that they should be actual functions that are called to reduce the code bloating
which then caused issues of its own. With that being said Planning was a huge take away from This, The assignment
seemed overwhelming at first however the two of us sat down and planned a taskboard together before even starting
this made the production of the shell a lot more approachable and I always had a clear goal when programming.
