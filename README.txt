Collectively we spent about 40 hours on the project.
(Tristian): 

(Jinhan): This assignment definitely required a lot of research into scandir(). We originally took a different
approach to reading files, but in order to achieve sorting the code was rewritten to use the built-in alphasort.
This is the first project for this semester where we did not use Jira to track issues and progress, which led to
a slow start and many reimplementation of methods because there weren't much planning. However, the assignment
was overall manageable and not overly intimidating.
