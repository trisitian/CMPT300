For question 1, approximately 2-3 hours were spent on reviewing basic operations in C and limitations, and an extra 1-2 hours to program and optimize the solution.
(Jinhan) I learned that in C, the manual allocation of memory is especially important for string/char array operations, and C is more limited than C++ in terms of string manipulation.
            Pointers are still quite confusing, but the compiler outputs help a lot with setting the correct type for variables.
            It was also a good practice on making Makefiles.
